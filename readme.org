:END:
* TODO [18/28] Todo and ideas
- [X] play with different modifier locations; not sure which work best with emacs
  - Home row mods allow for other things on thumb keys
- Consider combos on both hands for rare keys like escape
- [X] add macros for various common actions - miryoku has a lot of good examples
- Investigate tap/hold/tap-then-hold behaviours for thumb keys to allow for
  better repeat
- [X] Investigate repeat behaviour in general
- [X] Update home row mods for opposite-hand-specific behaviour
- [X] add ZMK Studo and keymap-drawer once keymap is solidified, zmk-viewer for
  stacked view of all layers
- [X] Homerow combo mods - Could put these on keys *above* homerow, but probably not necessary.
- [X] Build front and greek layers
- [X] buy 2x magic arms and magsafe/camera mount adapter
- [X] buy 2x desktop magsafe stands for use when standing
- [ ] Print adjustable (sliding width) magsafe mounting system to put keyboard on
  either side of either laptop or phone (or some sort of built-in screen + SBC)
- [X] Custom or individual keycaps - see below for symbols/colours
  - fkeycaps and yuzukeycaps for custom printing
  - CO2 laser engraving on some materials?
- [X] add zmk-helpers
- [X] add badjeff trackball driver and update to 3 levels of sensitivity
- [X] add auto-mouse layer
- [X] decide on switches - want something lighter than Kailh Box brown
- [ ] Smart space - switch space to shift/underscore/slash for typing camelCase,
  etc - exit on double space
- [ ] hold punctuation to place at end of line
- [X] Move caps lock to shift-caps word, add something different to hold on caps  word.
- [ ] Magic key that is either repeat or ... depending on preceding keys - fill in
  th, the, ch, etc.
- [ ] Add shift-top layer with other symbols
- [ ] Customize base symbol and numeric layers
- [ ] Switch to toggleable mods when on navigation layer?
- [ ] Add layer based on Aydin Controls 5119-1-0-011-00 Industrial Keyboard
- [ ] Add more repeat key, adaptive key, and tempo key behaviours
- [X] Add Delete on shift-backspace
- [X] Add back thumb keys on each layer to allow for repeat/only one layer at a
time.
- [X] Swap keys on thumbs around to match Dreymar config/reduce SFBs (numbered
  top->bottom, outside->inside):
  - Tab -> L1 (FRNT)
  - Space -> L2 (NUM)
  - Enter -> L3 (SPR)
  - Backspace -> L4 (Ctrl-Backspace)
  - -> L5 (TOP)
  - Repeat -> R1 (Can't have a hold function)
  - Sticky Shift -> R2 (TOP)
  - Alt-Tab -> R3 (NAV)
- [ ] Newly-free keys:
  - Right pinky - completely free -> Some sort of toggle to mirror caps word
  - Left pinky - hold free
  - Bottom right, left thumb: Tap free
  - Top left, left thumb: tap free
* Features
- Main layer
  - Repeat key: Left thumb cluster; can be held to repeat things that otherwise
    have a behaviour on hold.
  - Sticky shift: Right thumb cluster. Will remain until next character is sent.
  - Single alt tab on right thumb tap; alt-tab with timeout on two taps; layer key
    on hold.
  - Caps lock replaced with caps word that only ends on certain non-alphnumeric characters
    - Caps lock is available through shift-Caps Word; opens up hold for layer key
  - Homerow mods, with immediately-triggering behaviour when the next key is on
    the opposite hand
  - Hold-Backspace (on left thumb cluster) to send Ctrl-Backspace and remove
    entire word.
    - Shift-backspace sends delete/ctrl-delete
  - Mouse-key-based forward and backward are mapped to holding =.= and =,=, respectively
  - Press and hold numerals for F1-F10; F11 is =-= and F12 is =`= when on any other layer
- System layer: Hold =-=; for keyboard settings.
- Misc layer: Media, brightness, and volume settings; screen lock.
- Navigation layer: Movement keys, text selection
- Win layer - windows management keys
- Numpad layer: Should be accessible using left hand - creates numpad layer on
  right hand and adds delete and backspace to fingers on left hand.
- Symbols layer: Puts number symbols on left hand (R1-R2), parens on R3, and
  other symbols
- Front layer:
  Replicates Lisp keyboards (Space Cadet); Greek and other useful
  math symbols. Should be marked on the front of the key.
- Top layer:
  Replicates Lisp keyboards (Space Cadet); Logic and APL symbols.
  Should be marked above alphas
- Mouse layers
  - Automouse layer, also accessible through =z= and =/=
  - Scroll layer on =x= and =.=
  - Slow layer on =c= and =,=
  - Slow scrolling when both are held; implemented with a conditional layer
    instead of process_next, which feels like it should work.
** Switch notes
- Kailh Box Navy: too loud but good for caps word toggle key.
- Kailh Box Brown: quieter; too heavy to be comfortable.
- Reddragon Lime: Silent, good amount of pretravel; not sure if they're as
  light as I'd want yet.
* Aliexpress Charybdis notes :ARCHIVE:
* Future build notes
- Adjust thumbs to be further out
- Adjust pinky column to have more splay
- Raise trackball to be more flush with thumb cluster; vertically when tented.
- Better cutout for reset and power switches
- 0.5 mm deep cutout in for Magsafe ring
- Raised edge around outer keycaps to hide switches
- More speculative:
  - Bottom plate out of wood, middle out of ???, top edge out of metal
  - Either displays or large colored LEDs - figure out most visible position
    when mounted on chair
  - Alternately, one-piece bottom and sides, with a plate mounted on top to hold
    all the switches and (printed) curved parts; might give more options for
    machining/cutting base.
  - Materials that might look good: ultem, teak, cherry, rosewood, amber-colored
    resins, brass, glass
  - Shiny is probably better than matte for keycaps; either DES or SA profiles
    seem to have the right sort of character. See below for symbol/font
    discussion
  - Keycap Quarry has gorgeous stone keycaps; mostly convex.
- General principles and inspiration
  - Take inspiration from luxury goods, hand tools,
  - Lecson amps, Fons turntables, that one Japanese brand that made stone-look
    amp cases generally in vertical profile. I swear I didn't imagine it.

** Printing DES keycaps through JLCPCB
*** Skeletyl thumb keys - 6x
Pretty good frosted finish; will be curious to see how the ball from PCBway
compares. Need to do some research to figure out if these can/do fit on my
particular keyboard, as I'm getting interference between the innermost and
centre keys

* Switches
** Outemu Silent Lemon v3
Quiet with good pre-travel; could still be lighter and have a sharper tactile bump.
** Kailh Box Navy
Clicky and heavy; currently using one for caps word toggle switch.
** Kailh Box Brown
Too heavy for my taste, tiny amount of pre-travel
** Leobog Icesoul
35g, only feels slightly lighter than the Silent Lemon, but feels better. Ideal
switch would be similar sound, more pretravel, and an event lighter spring.
